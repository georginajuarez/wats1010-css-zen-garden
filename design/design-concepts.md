#Design Concepts
I want the content on this site to weave through the page (top to bottom), as if the user where on a roadtrip of information and design. With that in mind, I hope to add a road to the content background to help lead the user through the page content (top to bottom). Each section of information will be presented in bright colors that stand out from the road so that the user can "stop" at each section.

All the main content will be clearly displayed on the page at all times. The extras, like links to other designs and resources, will be presented as a fixed menu that will pop out with said info when the user hovers over it.

The hope is that all content will be clearly spaced out and easy to read and follow.
