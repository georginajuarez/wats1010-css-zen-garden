#Design Concepts
I want the content on this site to weave through the page (top to bottom), as if the user where on a roadtrip of information and design.

All the main content will be clearly displayed on the page at all times. The extras, like links to other designs and resources, will be presented as a fixed menu that will pop out with said info when the user hovers over it.

The hope is that all content will be clearly spaced out and easy to read.
